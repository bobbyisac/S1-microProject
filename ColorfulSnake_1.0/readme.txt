v1.0

run menu.py not colorfulsnake_4.py

1.0 updates:
    added menu (interaction with terminal is no longer required)
    pieces of snake now have rounded corners and lines between segments (looks much cleaner)
    bug fixes
    closer to PEP8 guidelines

PS: my highscores are 27 on easy, 23 on medium, and 16 on hard. You should beat them.
PPS: those highscores aren't very good. I spent a lot more time making it than playing it but now that it's finally at 1.0 I'll play it some more just for fun :)
